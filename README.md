## Project Overview

The Calculator-Forex project is a two-in-one application that offers the following features:

1. **Calculator**: A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This calculator provides a user-friendly interface for performing calculations.

2. **Currency Converter**: A currency converter that utilizes a Currency API to fetch real-time currency exchange rates and convert between different currencies. This feature allows you to input an amount in one currency and receive the equivalent amount in another selected currency.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Visual Studio (or any other C# development environment)
- Basic understanding of C# programming
- Internet connection for the Currency API integration
